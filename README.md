A simple progressive web app that gets curency exchange rates from an API.

It started life as a weather forecast PWA from this tutorial: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/

It was then horribly hacked into existence to work with currencies for a lightning talk demo (so that's why lots of the methods still refer to weather forecasts).
